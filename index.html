			<p>Hello! My name is Patrick Ly. I am a second-year (third-year standing) 
			Computer Science student. Currently, my plan is to apply for the BS/MS
			program to obtain my Master's Degree as well as minor in both Japanese and 
			Game Design &amp; Development. My hobbies include reading, creating tools/programs to
			make simple tasks even easier, and playing/creating games (both board games and video games).</p>
